#TODO

1. Implement the User Interface for Issie
2. Improve Wire Routing and perhaps allow users to create and delete individual segments
3. Allow the Catalogue to be able to disappear when 
4. Merge the 3 models (to eliminate redundancy)
5. Also, improve interfacing between modules to remove the need for the same data being present in more than one module.
